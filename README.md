## Upgrade Parkour
- Capstone project developed over a few months, though this pivoted (was completely reimagined) twice so the current iteration really only is like 1 month of work.
- 3D parkour game inspired by minecraft parkour courses where you can choose a movement upgrade after each level.
- Made in Unity.
- SFX made by modifying irl sounds.
- Music made in Bosca Ceoil.
